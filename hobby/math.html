  <h1> Advanced learning in math </h1>
    <p> Most of my life math has been most appealing to me from the other subjects. </p>
    <p> Math was important to me and had been easy to me throughout middle school. </p>
    <p> Because of this I went to take advanced math courses in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. </p>
