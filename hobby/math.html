  <h1> Advanced learning in math </h1>
    <p> Most of my life math has been most appealing to me from the other subjects. </p>
    <p> Math was important to me and had been easy to me throughout middle school. </p>
    <p> Because of this I went to take advanced math courses in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. </p>

  <h1> Afficient Math </h1>
    <p> Afficient Math had helped me to excel my learning in math. </p>
    <p> This is an online system which helps me learn my math in an accelerated manner. </p>
    <p> It allowed me to accelerate through 7th Grade the most and in 8th Grade I finished Pre-Calc</p>
    <p> It has been the most useful math system I have taken because of the state I am in now</p>

  <h1>AMC</h1>
    <p>I haven't really done well with AMC's.</p>
    <p>The reason behind this is because I find word problems confusing and it takes extra time to decode it.</p>
