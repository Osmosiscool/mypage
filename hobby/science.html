  <h1> Wonders of Science </h1>
    <p> I found science to be one of the more interesting subjects compared to the rest. </p>
    <p> I had scored A's and sometimes B's easily in 7th and 8th grade because it seemed easier to retain the facts. </p>
    <p>I generally found physics and chemistry most intriguing.</p>
  <h1>Earth Science</h1>
    <h2>Just Rocks</h2>
      <p>From the title you can tell it wasn't my favorite part of science.</p>
      <p>It was really boring and I didn't remember much except erosion and the rock cycle.</p>
      <p>The landforms were more interesting such as volcanoes to deep ocean trenches</p>
    <h2>Outer Space</h2>
      <p>This was my favorite part of Earth Science because it was about astronomical theories</p>
      <p>Although I still learned about rocks(meteors), there were other interesting stuff like black holes and galaxies.</p>
      <p>I also learned about other theoretical stuff like dark matter.</p>
  <h1>Biology</h1>
    <h2>Cells</h2>
      <p>Cells were generally hard to memorize because of the various parts of it.</p>
      <p>DNA's were my least favorite part because of all the codon triplets and RNA confusing stuff.</p>
    <h2>Living Things</h2>
      <p>This was my favorite part of biology because of the categorization of the different organisms.</p>
      <p>I also learned about animals and the environments they live in.</p>
      <p>My favorite part were the invertebrates because of their cool structures and different functions they use.</p>
  <h1>Chemistry</h1>
    <h2>The Table</h2>
      <p>The periodic table wasn't actually dreaded because I didn't have to memorize it.</p>
      <p>In fact it helped understand valence electrons for elements.</p>
      <p>By the end of the unit I had almost memorized the valence electrons for the elements.</p>
    <h2>Organic Chemistry</h2>
      <p>This was my favorite part of chemistry because the prefixes that make up confusing structures actually made sense.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot of stuff from organic chemistry including actual real life things made from these carbon chains.</p>
      <p>These things include mustard gas, amino acid, and different alchohols.</p>
  <h1>Physics</h1>
      <p>I am currently still learning physics but it had seemed very interesting to me so far.</p>
      <p>The many various formulas in physics was intriguing because it had some connection with mathematical formulas.</p>
      <p>In fact most of the terms realting in physics had relations to math such as frequency/waves or vectors.</p>
      <p>I had also researched some aspect on magnetism before I learned physics which seemed interesting because of the way electrons align.</p>
