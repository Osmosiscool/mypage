  <h1> Wonders of Science </h1>
    <p> I found science to be one of the more interesting subjects compared to the rest. </p>
    <p> I had scored A's and sometimes B's easily in 7th and 8th grade because it seemed easier to retain the facts. </p>
    <p>I generally found physics and chemistry most intriguing</p>
  <h1>Earth Science</h1>
    <h2>Just Rocks</h2>
      <p>From the title you can tell it wasn't my favorite part of science.</p>
      <p>It was really boring and I didn't remember much except erosion and the rock cycle.</p>
      <p>The landforms were more interesting such as volcanoes to deep ocean trenches</p>
    <h2>Outer Space</h2>
      <p>This was my favorite part of Earth Science because it was about astronomical theories</p>
      <p>Although I still learned about rocks(meteors) there were other interesting stuff like black holes and galaxies.</p>
